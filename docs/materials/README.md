# Building Web Applications in R with Shiny

## Course description

Shiny is a web application framework for R that you can use to turn your analyses into interactive web applications. Shiny apps can allow your users to interact with the data, browse results, and run their own analyses. The interactive platform is an alternative to a static report and provides a modern, attrative interface for communicating results.
