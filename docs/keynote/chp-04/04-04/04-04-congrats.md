# You now know how to get started with building web apps in R with Shiny! 

# In this course you have learned how to design a Shiny app from scratch and the essentials of reactive programming. You also got practice with customizing your app's UI and employing reactivity best practices. I hope you enjoyed the course and that the topics we discussed in this course motivated you to build your first, and second, and third Shiny app! Once you build your first app, you have a variety of deployment options.

# The first is shinyapps.io. This is a server maintained by RStudio, that is easy to use, secure, and scalable. It comes with built in metrics, and has a free tier available.

# If you prefer to build your own server you can use Shiny Server, which is free and open source. It runs on premises, moving your computation closer to your data.

# RStudio also offers two Pro options for deploying your apps: Shiny Server Pro and RStudio Connect. You can find out more about all of these options at shiny.rstudio.com/deploy.

# What we covered in this course is just the tip of the Shiny iceberg, so I hope you decide to dive deeper to learn more. We can't wait to see the apps you create online!
